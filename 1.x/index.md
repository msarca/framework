description: Learn how to install the Opis Colibri framework
---

Before proceeding with the framework installation, make sure that you have [NodeJS], [Composer] and [Yarn] installed and
globally available. 
Opis Colibri use Composer to manage its dependencies, while NodeJS and Yarn are used for automatic asset management. 

## Installing the framework

Installing the Opis Colibri framework is straightforward and is done with the help of 
Composer, by issuing a `create-project` command.

```bash
composer create-project opis-colibri/app website.test
```

Once the project have been installed, you can go into its folder and start a server
instance by using PHP's built-in development server.

```bash
cd website.test
php -S localhost:8080 -t public router.php
```
